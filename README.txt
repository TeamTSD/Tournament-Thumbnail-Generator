TournamentThumbnailGenerator is a thumbnail design program intended to speed up the process of producing thumbnails for video uploads from tournaments. Written by willyjwillyj on commission from TeamTSD, This program was designed with the principles of Tetris adjacent games in mind, but can easily be used for tournaments of any kind. The main feature intended for use with this program is its batching process, with lets you make a large number of thumbnails at one time.

The program will make a thumbnail based on the user input. Using the program, the user creates multiple objects, each of which gets pasted onto the image in order. Effects work similarily, the effects are applied onto the objects in order. Any sizes are the dimensions of the object before rotation is applied. Location refers to where the center of the object should be placed.

To make a batch of images, you will need a .csv file with the configuration settings. For each column in the csv, the first row should be the number of which object in the list you need to change, and each row should be the details of what that object's parameters should become. For text, you can change the text that is in the image. For an image, you can change the file path of the image.
